Algorithm Explanation:

1.Start by defining two functions: power(base, exponent) and isArmstrongNumber(number). The power function calculates the value of base raised to the power of exponent.

2.In the isArmstrongNumber function, find the number of digits (n) in the given number by converting it to a string and calculating its length.

3.Initialize a variable sum to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the nth power of each digit in the number.

4.Create a temporary variable temp and set it to the value of the number. This temporary variable will be used for calculations.

5.Use a while loop to iterate until temp becomes 0. In each iteration:
a. Extract the last digit of temp using the modulo operator (%), and store it in a variable called digit.
b. Add the nth power of digit to the sum.
c. Remove the last digit from temp using the floor division operator (/).

6.After the while loop, compare sum with the original number. If they are equal, return true, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, return false.

7.In the main part of the script, prompt the user to enter a number with n digits and store the input in the userInput variable.

8.Convert the userInput to an integer using parseInt and store it in the number variable.

10.Call the isArmstrongNumber function with the number as an argument to check if the number is an Armstrong number.

11.Display the result to the user using an alert box
